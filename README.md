# heart disease detector predictor
The Heart Disease Detector and Predictor is a machine learning project developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. The model was trained using a dataset containing approximately 1,000 rows, focusing on key features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved.

Features:

Data Analysis: Explores and visualizes health-related datasets to identify patterns and correlations.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
